# Project: Guide Into The World of ML
Under this I learnt the following:

Python: Basics of OOP in python and various std libraries useful for data sci, data analysis and interpretation. These include:
Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, statistics, random and scipy.

Statistics: Basics of statistics and various concepts useful for data sci like: variable measurement scales, sampling techniques, various type of plots/graphs and their meaning and usecase,
mathematical quantities associated with a dataset, process of removing outliers, various distributions - Normal/Gaussian, Lognormal, Bernoulli's, Pareto's, interpretation and mathematics associated
with Gaussian distributions - hypothesis testing, p-values, significance value, Zscores, Z-test, t-test, Confidence Interval, covariance, Pearson correlation coeff, Spearman Rank correlation, Centarl Limit Thm.

# Project Description - Data Analysis and Interpretation
For the given/provided dataset I have written code in Jupyter notebook file which first processes, stores/reads the data. It then processes it using various std pythonic libraries like numpy and calculates
important mathematical details of the data such as the mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

Then various types of plots of various numerical or categorical data columns from the given dataset have been displayed (using seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot) and I have drawn conclusions from the same,
trying to qualitatively interpret the data.
