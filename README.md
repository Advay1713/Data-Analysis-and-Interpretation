# Project: Guide into the World of Machine Learning

This repository contains my work for the **WIDS (Winter School of Data Science) Winter Study Project**, titled *“Guide into the World of Machine Learning”*.  
The project focuses on building a strong foundation in Python, data analysis, statistics, data visualization, and basic machine learning concepts, with an emphasis on understanding ideas from first principles.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to gain a structured introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning by progressing step by step from programming fundamentals to statistical modeling and linear regression.  
The learning approach combined theory, mathematical intuition, and hands-on implementation using Python.

The project broadly covers:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Numerical computing with NumPy
- Data analysis and preprocessing using Pandas
- Statistics and probability concepts
- Data visualization techniques
- Linear regression implemented from scratch

## Repository Contents

### 1. `Data Analysis and Interpretation.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on:
- Exploring datasets using Pandas
- Cleaning and preprocessing data
- Computing descriptive statistics
- Visualizing data using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and line plots
- Interpreting patterns, trends, and outliers in real-world data

This file helped build intuition about how given data can be qualitatively interpreted using various plots and graphs before applying any machine learning model.

### 2. `Simple Linear Regression Model.ipynb`
This notebook contains:
- Implementation of **simple linear regression from scratch**
- Mathematical derivation of slope and intercept
- Use of NumPy for efficient numerical computation
- Visualization of regression line and data points
- Evaluation of model performance using concepts like residuals and R² score

The focus here was on understanding *how linear regression works internally*, rather than relying on libraries like scikit-learn.

### 3. `WIDS_Report.pdf`
This is the final project report written in LaTeX.  
It documents:
- Theoretical background of Python, statistics, data visualization, and machine learning
- Mathematical formulation of linear regression
- Explanation of concepts such as variance, distributions, hypothesis testing, and R²
- Reflections and learning outcomes from the project

This report serves as a consolidated summary of both theory and implementation.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How Python can be used effectively for data science tasks
- The importance of NumPy for vectorized numerical computation
- How to clean, preprocess, and analyze data using Pandas
- Core statistical concepts required to understand real-world data
- How data visualization helps in interpreting and validating results
- The complete working of linear regression, both mathematically and programmatically

Most importantly, this project strengthened my understanding of machine learning foundations rather than treating models as black boxes.
